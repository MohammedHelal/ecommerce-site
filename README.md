# eCommerce Website
A simple eCommerce website built using Fake Store API instead of a database for the info.
The site opens to products page, you can filter the products by either category or rating.
to see an items details or move to the cart click on its image.

Adding it to the cart will cause the counter of the cart in the navbar to increase to confirm you added the item to the cart.
you can go to the cart either by pressing buy or clicking the cart button on the navbar.

Since this app was made with React and API the cart items are kept in the state so as soon as you reload the page the cart will empty.
